# Customer Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression and Random Forest

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses, as retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project develops machine learning models to **predict customer churn** using features derived from **demographics**, **transaction history**, **customer service interactions**, and **online activity**.

The workflow includes **data exploration**, **feature engineering**, and applying two machine learning algorithms: **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier**, followed by thorough **model evaluation and comparison**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The project utilizes customer data from multiple Excel sheets:

* **Customer\_Demographics** â€“ Basic customer information (e.g., age, gender)
* **Transaction\_History** â€“ Purchase behavior (e.g., spending, frequency)
* **Customer\_Service** â€“ Interactions with support (e.g., service usage, complaints)
* **Online\_Activity** â€“ Web/app usage patterns

---

## ðŸ”Ž Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key steps performed during EDA:

* Visualizing churn vs. non-churn customer distribution
* Analyzing spending patterns and transaction frequency
* Exploring service usage and complaints
* Investigating correlations between features

Visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

---

## ðŸ›  Feature Engineering

* Aggregated transaction metrics per customer
* Summarized service usage statistics
* Encoded categorical features using **LabelEncoder**
* Merged all datasets into a unified analytical dataset

---

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models

Two machine learning models were implemented and compared:

* **Logistic Regression** â€“ A simple, interpretable baseline model
* **Random Forest Classifier** â€“ An ensemble model for improved performance

### Evaluation Metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* ROC-AUC Curve

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

* **Logistic Regression** provided a solid baseline for churn prediction.
* **Random Forest Classifier** delivered better performance in terms of **accuracy** and **ROC-AUC**, making it the preferred model.
